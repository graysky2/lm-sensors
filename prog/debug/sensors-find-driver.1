.SH NAME
sensors-find-driver \- find driver corresponding to a sensor chip
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sensors-find-driver
.I chip-name

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sensors-find-driver
Chip name is a string in the format
.I <chip>-<bus>-<address>
as reported by the
.I sensors
program. For example the chip name can be
.I coretemp-isa-0000
or
.I acpitz-virtual-0
.P
If the
.I sensors
program does not report useful values for certain hardware
monitoring inputs, the problem in most cases is not in lm_sensors. lm_sensors
only reads values exported by the Linux kernel. Finding the driver responsible
for exporting the particular hardware monitoring chip may help to diagnose
the problem further. It is possible that there is a bug in the driver, however
it is even more likely that the input is simply not used on your board.

Nonetheless, identifying the driver may help you identify the piece of hardware
that reports the bogus value.

This script finds the driver and kernel module responsible for exporting
a hardware monitoring chip in sysfs. It should be given the chip name as
reported by the
.I sensors

program as argument. For example:

.br
$ sensors
.br
thinkpad-isa-0000
.br
Adapter: ISA adapter
.br
fan1:           0 RPM
.br

.br
$ sensors-find-driver thinkpad-isa-0000
.br
Driver: thinkpad_hwmon
.br
Module: thinkpad_acpi
